# Practice 1: Variables and Data Types

In this practice, you will work with variables and data types in Python. You will learn how to declare variables, assign
values, and perform operations on different data types. By completing the exercises, you will gain a better
understanding of how variables work and how to manipulate data in your programs.

## Exercises

1. Basic Arithmetic:

   Task: Write a program that takes two integer values as input and performs the following operations: addition,
   subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
   Example Input: 5, 3
   Example Output: 8 (addition), 2 (subtraction), 15 (multiplication), 1.666... (division), 2 (modulus)

2. Temperature Conversion:

   Task: Write a program that converts a temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The formula for conversion
   is: `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`.
   Example Input: 25.0 (Celsius)
   Example Output: 77.0 (Fahrenheit)

3. String Manipulation:

   Task: Take a string as input and print its length, the first character, the last character, and the string in reverse
   order.
   Example Input: "Python"
   Example Output: 6 (length), "P" (first), "n" (last), "nohtyP" (reversed)

4. Even or Odd:

   Task: Write a program that takes an integer as input and determines if it's even or odd.
   Example Input: 7
   Example Output: Odd

5. Simple Interest Calculation:

   Task: Write a program to calculate simple interest using the formula: SI = (P * T * R) / 100 (where P = Principal
   amount, T = Time period in years, R = Rate of interest).
   Example Input: P = 10000, T = 3, R = 5
   Example Output: 1500.0

6. Area of a Triangle:

   Task: Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height using the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height
   Example Input: base = 10, height = 8
   Example Output: 40.0

7. BMI Calculator:

   Task: Write a program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person. BMI Formula: weight (kg) / (height (m) *
   height (m))
   Example Input: weight = 75 (kg), height = 1.75 (m)
   Example Output: 24.49

8. Grade Calculator:

   Task: Write a program that calculates the average of three test scores and assigns a letter grade based on the
   average.
   Grading Scale (Example): 90-100: A, 80-89: B, 70-79: C, 60-69: D, Below 60: F
   Example Input: 85, 92, 78
   Example Output: Average: 85.0, Grade: B

9. Largest of Three Numbers:

   Task: Write a program that finds the largest of three numbers.
   Example Input: 12, 5, 23
   Example Output: 23

10. Swapping Variables:

   Task: Write a program to swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.
   Example Input: a = 5, b = 10
   Example Output: a = 10, b = 5
