# Practice 3: Loops & Validation

This practice session focuses on `for` and `while` loops, essential tools for repetitive tasks and controlling program
flow. You'll also learn how to implement input validation to ensure users provide valid data.

## Exercises

1. **Number Sequence:**
    - **Task:** Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20. Then, use a `while` loop to print the numbers from
      20 down to 1.

2. **Sum of Numbers:**
    - **Task:** Write a program that continuously asks the user to enter numbers until they enter 0. Calculate and
      display the sum of all the numbers entered.

3. **Multiplication Table (Input Validation):**
    - **Task:** Ask the user for a number between 1 and 12. Validate the input to ensure it's within the valid range.
      Then, use a `for` loop to generate and print the multiplication table for that number up to 12.

4. **Guess the Number (Enhanced):**
    - **Task:** Enhance the Number Guessing Game from Practice 2. This time, limit the user to a specific number of
      guesses (e.g., 5 attempts). Use a `while` loop to control the game, keep track of guesses, and provide feedback.

5. **Factorial with Validation:**
    - **Task:** Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number. Ensure the input is a non-negative integer
      using a `while` loop for validation. If the input is invalid, keep asking for a valid number.

6. **Fibonacci Sequence with Limit:**
    - **Task:** Ask the user for a limit. Use a `while` loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to that limit. Print
      each number in the sequence.

7. **Pattern Printing (Customizable):**
    - **Task:** Create a program that asks the user for a character (e.g., '*') and the number of rows. Use nested loops
      to print a customizable pattern using that character. (Allow for various pattern shapes, like triangles,
      rectangles, or diamonds).

8. **Average Calculator (with Validation):**
    - **Task:** Write a program that calculates the average of a set of numbers. Continuously ask the user for numbers
      until they enter a negative number to signal the end of input. Use input validation to make sure only positive
      numbers are included in the average calculation.

9. **Prime Number Checker (Range):**
    - **Task:** Ask the user for a starting and ending number. Use nested loops to find and print all prime numbers
      within that range.

10. **Password Generator (with Criteria):**
    - **Task:** Create a program that generates random passwords. Ask the user for the desired password length and
      whether it should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Use loops and
      conditional statements to ensure the generated password meets the criteria.
