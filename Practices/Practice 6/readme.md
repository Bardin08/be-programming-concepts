# Practice 6: Tuple & Dictionary

This practice session focuses on `tuple` and `dictionary` collections, essential tools for repetitive tasks and 
working with structured data. You'll learn how to access, manipulate, and iterate over these collections.

## Exercises

1. Nesting Tuples
   Create a tuple nested_t that contains another tuple ('a', 'b', 'c') and a list [1, 2, 3]. Write a program, that
   accesses and prints the second element of the nested tuple and the third element of the nested list.
2. Counting Elements in Tuple
   Write a program, that takes a tuple t and an element, and returns the number of times the element appears in the
   tuple.
3. Checking Key Existence
   Write a program that takes a dictionary d and a key, and prints True if the key exists in the dictionary, otherwise
   False.
4. Combining Tuples and Dictionaries
   Write a program that creates a dictionary where keys are tuples representing coordinates (e.g., (0, 0), (1, 2)) and
   values are the names of dotes. For example, {(0, 0): “A”, (1, 2): “B”}. Print the resulting dictionary.
5. Filtering Dictionary
   Write a program that takes a dictionary d where values are integers and an integer threshold, and prints a new
   dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than threshold.
6. Dictionary of Tuples
   Write a program that takes a dictionary d where values are tuples of integers, and prints a new dictionary with the
   same keys, but where the values are the sums of the integers in the original tuples.
7. Word Frequency Counter
   Write a program that takes a string of text and returns a dictionary where the keys are words and the values are the
   number of times each word appears in the text.
8. Inventory Management
   Create a dictionary to manage an inventory of items in a store. The keys should be item names and the values should
   be the quantity in stock. Implement functions to add items, remove items, and update stock levels.
9. Student Grades
   Design a dictionary to store students' grades, where the key is the student's name and the value is a list of their
   grades. Implement functions to add a grade, calculate the average grade for each student, and find the student with
   the highest average grade.
