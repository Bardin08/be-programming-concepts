# Practice 5: List & Set

This repository contains Python programs demonstrating various operations on sets and lists using lambda functions and
built-in functions like `filter()` and `map()`.

## Set Operations

1. **Create a Set**: `create_set.py` - Creates a set and assigns it to a variable.
2. **Iterate Over Sets**: `iterate_sets.py` - Iterates over the elements of a set using a loop.
3. **Add Members to a Set**: `add_to_set.py` - Adds one or more members to an existing set.
4. **Remove Items from a Set**: `remove_from_set.py` - Removes specified item(s) from a given set.
5. **Remove Item from Set if Present**: `remove_if_present.py` - Removes an item from a set if it is present.
6. **Create Intersection of Sets**: `intersection_of_sets.py` - Creates the intersection of two sets.
7. **Create Union of Sets**: `union_of_sets.py` - Creates the union of two sets.
8. **Create Set Difference**: `set_difference.py` - Creates the set difference between two sets.

## List Operations with Lambda Functions

1. **Filter Out Even Numbers**: `filter_even_numbers.py` - Filters out even numbers from a list using `filter()` and a
   lambda function.
2. **Filter Out Strings Containing 'a'**: `filter_strings_with_a.py` - Filters out strings containing the letter 'a'
   from a list using `filter()` and a lambda function.
3. **Create New List with Squared Numbers**: `map_squared_numbers.py` - Creates a new list where each number is squared
   using `map()` and a lambda function.
4. **Create New List with Greetings**: `map_greetings.py` - Creates a new list where each name has a greeting appended
   using `map()` and a lambda function.
