# Practice 2: Conditional Operations

This practice session builds upon your knowledge of variables and data types by introducing conditional operations in
Python. You'll work with `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`),
and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to create programs that make decisions and branch based on different
conditions.

## Exercises

1. Number Comparison:

   Task: Take two numbers as input and print which one is larger or if they are equal.

2. Leap Year Checker:

   Task: Determine if a given year is a leap year. (A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not divisible by
   100 unless it is also divisible by 400.)

3. Vowel or Consonant:

   Task: Take a single character as input and check if it's a vowel or consonant.

4. Quadrant Identifier:

   Task: Take x and y coordinates as input and determine the quadrant in which the point (x, y) lies.

5. Password Strength Checker:

   Task: Check the strength of a password based on the following criteria:
    1. Minimum length of 8 characters
    2. Contains at least one uppercase letter
    3. Contains at least one lowercase letter
    4. Contains at least one digit
    5. Contains at least one special character

6. Grade Calculator (Enhanced):

   Task: Enhance the Grade Calculator from Practice 1. This time, allow the user to input the weight (percentage
   contribution) of each test score. Calculate the weighted average and assign a grade accordingly.

7. Discount Calculator:

   Task: Calculate the discounted price of an item based on the original price and a discount percentage. Offer
   additional discounts for members or if the purchase amount exceeds a certain threshold.

8. Calculator (Extended):

   Task: Extend the Simple Calculator from Practice 1 to handle additional operations like exponentiation, square root,
   and trigonometric functions (using the math module).

9. Number Guessing Game:

   Task: Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user then tries to guess the number. The
   program provides feedback (too high or too low) until the correct number is guessed.

10. Text-Based Adventure Game (Simplified):

    Task: Create a simple text-based adventure game where the user makes choices that lead to different outcomes. Use
    if...else statements to create branching paths in the story.

    Example: The user starts in a room and can choose to go north, south, east, or west. Each direction leads to a
    different room with a unique description and options.
